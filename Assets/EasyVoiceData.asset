  speechTexts:
  - yo dude, I have some weird shit I'm gonna tell ya later.
  - Every night I have the same dream...
  - I'm chasing a cat down the street, and just as I'm about to catch up to it, the
    cat turns. It has your face.
  - The you-cat gives out a loud hiss. So I crouch down, trying to approach the cat,
    gently. Calm.
  - And you're still hissing while I crouch and approach but you don't scratch me
    or move away.
  - Instead, when my hand gets to your head to give you some of the good good scratches...
    The cat turns into MY MOTHER.
  - And then I wake up and I've wet the bed... This happens every night... My sheets
    are so fucked up.
  - We've known each other for so long that this shouldn't bother you.
  - Anyway, in the dream, you're the cat and then you turn into my mom.
  - What does it all mean? I'll tell you what it means... Oh wait, I think you're
    getting a call.
  - Sometimes I think about being a kid. You know, when our mom's would gossip together
    about Glorf whateverthefuck news while we'd play outside of the hyperscope.
  - Ding ding! My mom would ring the blinner bell for us to come back inside. We'd
    start to head inside and you'd get in and she'd stop me before I could and look
    at me.
  - And she'd look at me and say 'Yinkel would've sniffed it better'... Every fucking
    day. She said this fucking thing to me.
  - What does it even mean dude? I don't know. I'm sure you don't know either.
  - But yeah back to my dream... So I'm chasing you, the cat. Am I chasing you to
    get inside the house? Before my mom can complain to me about... About Yinkel?
  - I don't think that's what the dream means... Who the fuck even was Yinkel? God...
  - Yeah but I think the dream is about... about the cornmaze dude...
  - Hah. Yeah. I got ya with the hooker, you're stuck deep in your job now, and ya
    can't run outta the room... Can't run away from your problems.
  - CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM OUR PROBLEMS... WHAT THE FUCK BRO?????? Why?
  - Your clumsly little legs you're always tripping all over them... You had to fall
    on your face with your legs tied up in a knot like that...
  - Oh yeah! I'll just help 'em up! No problemo! It's me friend! We're in a cornmaze!'
  - The cornmaze is haunted! We want to leave! Let me help my friend up because my
    friend fell on the ground because of my friend having 8 octopus legs.
  - Yeah you had to fall with your stupid octopus legs on your face in the scariest
    corn maze of Glorf 31!
  - And then when I want to help my friend up my friend's like, 'oh, thank you Guambo.'
    AND THEN YOU PULL ME IN AND GIVE ME A KISS... ON MY LIPS...
  - Why did you kiss my lips? With your lips? We were in a haunted corn maze! There
    was a man with a chainsaw running after us!
  - Your eight legs were tied in a knot, and I had to untie them, and the kiss made
    untying them Super Weird.
  - And you know what dude? That wasn't even the worst part! I've specifically avoided
    mentioning it always!
  - When other people bring up kissing in front of us, you grimace, roll your eyes
    at me, and then RUN OUT OF THE ROOM.
  - YOU ARE THE CAT RUNNING AWAY FROM ME. IT'S NOT EVEN A METAPHOR. YOU are LITERALLY
    RUNNING AWAY FROM ME WHENEVER KISSING IS MENTIONED.
  - It it's not even necessarily about us... No, that's not the worst part... The
    worst part is that night after night I'm BLASTING my sheets with NO RELIEF in
    sight!
  - Like you make it so weird dude! We could just not mention it...
  - '''Yinkel would''ve sniffed it better...'' What does that even mean? Sniffed
    what? Who''s Yinkel?'
  - God dude, I'm so blazed right now.
  - Fuck you, fuck my mom... I'm gonna blast this couch... At least you couldn't
    run away this time...
  - Hello there. I am Dr. Elglore Smankoff, PHD. We at Glarblarf Inc have assigned
    you to monitor Glorf-31 activity at this world here, 'Earth.' We will be sending
    agents who want to, per say, 'mess with the earth,' over your way to be approved
    or disapproved by you, Lixel Zeoop, Glorf-31 citizen and valued employee of Glarblarf
    Inc. Press one of the buttons in front of you to start up your work for the day.
  - Would you say this paper mache donkey depicting a flatulating, gesticulating
    great ape properly represents the contemporary of the general human cognition?
  - I think you need to include a little bit more common greater good egalitarianism
    energy or something.
  - Are donkeys not viabley connected to the greater good??? They're just horse babies,
    dude!
  - I would like to mine out some of the cave paintings found in Catalonia, bring
    them back to the Eternal Museum back on Glorf 31. It would contribute greatly
    to our collection of Earth artifacts. Can I have your go ahead?
  - It looks like you sort of pissed off the Earthlings a bit there.
  - 'The camera: a useful earthling invention. Bro we would''ve never come up with
    such a toy, with our eye cones being so different.'
  - I have an idea for an art installation to bring to Earth. It is to invert the
    colors of every object with visually metallic property, ie. roadsigns, buildings,
    volcanic activity. This is important for my and the entirety of Glorf 31's artistic
    expression and species signature upon the universe.
  - I wonder if we'll see all metal with inverted colors also... is Goya gonna change
    like the properties or something or the way organisms percieve things?
  - Goya's always got something up those many sleeves...
  - I would like to change the fundamental concept of music that humans have to one
    that includes not only aural sensory input but also patterned smell over time.
  - This music smells like quaft.
  - Beethoven, that dude rocks on.
  - I need paint.
  - Rock tones, major mood.
  - That paint won't be vegan, dude.
  - I hate brutalism so much.
  - TEAR IT DOWN!
  - Who doesn't brutalism hate?
  - I've found something worse than Brutalism in terms of aesthetic movements...
    its name is Frank Lloyd Wright.
  - Bro I think that he may just keep coming back with these grievences and such...
  - YOUR Spaceship can fall on MY water. ;)
  - 'Oh no. I''ve found the worst one. How could the humans do this to their eye
    cones? One word phrase: Rococo.'
  - Isn't the reason they pay you for this because no one else wants to deal with
    these dudes?
  - You and all alien counterpart poodles, dude.
  - I have figured out what to do about the terrible architectural aspects of the
    human earth. With Eglore Smankoff's architectural-change-a-doodle ray, we can
    turn all their buildings into the human-sacrum like structures of our home planet,
    my dearest Lixel Zeoop!
  - Ohhh noooo bro...
  - You mean in the verbal sense, because SSS'SSSS doesn't communicate through sound,
    right?
  - I have thought about your comment... that I am becoming similar to our colleage,
    SS'SSS... I have realized this is not what Art is about. It is about freedom,
    self expression, communication. I got too wrapped up in my own tastes. Thank
    you, Lixel Zeoop. Thank you.
  - What an epiphany. Seems we aren't the only ones who can't stand SS'SSSS.
  - (Thumbs up emoji)
  - Hey. Uh. I... I don't think people are horny enough. I like went to the bar last
    night and no one talked to me and I was looking FANTASTIC. You're gonna have
    to do something about it.
  - Wow bro, time for a major earth fuckfest I guess. I bet Torbar still won't get
    any, though.
  - Haha what the fuck even was that.
  - In my time undercover I have learned that maybe eighty human years ago there
    was an era known as dis-co. We should bring it back. I believe in the importance
    of thriving human night life.
  - Haha yes! Fuck it up!
  - Eh bro don't cramp disco. Maybe you're just uncultured.
  - I auditioned to be on this human communal preformance troupe thing called the
    Broadest Way. I got in, I am now going to be playing a human pretending to be
    a cat, doing some aerobic escapade. I am afraid i will lose myself in the layers
    of pretend. Who am I?
  - We've got a motivational speaker in the house woop woop!
  - Tell it to him straight! Or something.
  - NASA wants to send me to space. Can we meet up while I'm there?
  - Fuck I hate that guy why'd you give him our address?
  - Haha yeah! Tell him to his face!
  - Any tips on hiding flagellum?
  - Hats are GREAT for that.
  - I think you gave Torbar the wrong advice there, dude.
  - An Earth human asked me for my hand in marriage. Is it time to tie the knot?
    What if i get tied down?
  - What about listening to your brains?
  - We've got one married in! Hurrah for Glorf!
  - Your failure to control the human urge to dominate eachother has resulted in
    carnage and war. The surface of the planet is highly irradiated and the population
    has undergone mutations that make them less susceptible to mind control. We are
    highly disatisfied with your work. Goodbye... Loser.
  - This planet has become too submissive thanks to your influence. People are volunteering
    to act as human pavement in hopes of being stepped on, but no one wants to do
    the stepping. As a result, transportation has broken down and I can't sell any
    of my goods. This is a disaster. You're fired.
  - Oh god. Oh god. They're all. They're all so horny- I can't get any humans to
    partake in my experiments because they keep... Mating! I've never seen mating
    before. It makes me uncomfortable. I need immediate transportation off of the
    planet! How could you let this happen? You are fired!
  - Idk man this planet sucks bigtime. No one is trying to give me kisses and stuff
    or ride my grill. Totally lame. I bet it's your fault, I'm reporting you to Bloof
    Gloof. BTW, birth rates have plummeted and humanity is dying out, so good job,
    I guess.
  - Hey I'm sweating too much... My AC is broken... :( I think I saw the humans burning
    alive from the extreme heat. Now I'll never make friends :(
  - Dude this planet is fricking cold man! I hate it here! Yesterday I saw a dogs
    peepee freeze in mid air! That was gross! I'm leaving a very negative review
    of this planet on Glorf Yelp and telling your manager!
  - Congratulations. Through your discussions with your friend, you have achieved
    enlightenment and transcended reality.
  - Let's make this salamander I found floating in space president of Russia!
  - Oh! I love him so much! What a great leader!
  - The little guy seems to be vibing down there at the pole.
  - Mandatory clown noses for all crustaceons, yes?
  - Haha! All those crabs look so silly now!
  - Not today, Bloof Gloof. Boo hoo.
  - I would like to move the earth five centimeters to the left!
  - I wonder how he's gonna manage that with just a rope... He'll figure it out some
    way.
  - That's too bad, I was looking forward to what Bloof Gloof would've done...
  - All human auditory ability only now able to parse sounds of clown horn honking?
  - That HAS to be a form of capital punishment...
  - You DID say when hell freezes over... what else could you expect from that guy?
  - It is birthday time for the Earth day. All will celebrate.
  - All will celebrate.
  - I can't believe you challenged Bloof Gloof...
  - Make all other clowns fight to the death.
  - Battle-ring clown style. My next TV program.
  - Clown orgy on you, dude.
  - The Mire Oodle said they were being the bullied. Should I Gloof my Bloof?
  - You'll never learn. None of us will learn.
  - I always have to close my eyes when Bloof Gloof does this.
  - MY GLOOF HAS BEEN BLOOFED UPON THE BULLIES OF MIRE OODLE.
  - Mire really has a social sway at Glarblarff, it seems.
  - The bullies are anyone who breathes without caressing Mire Oodle.
  - So because I'm cold blooded I tend to get exhausted in colder temperatures...
    would you be able to crank the heat up a little bit for me? It would make earth
    a better vacay spot suited to my needs.
  - Haha bro I hope the earthlings can handle extra winter.
  - Aw dude, but Zem Lips needs that heat! Haha i'm just messing with you I don't
    care.
  - Would you recommend visiting Dubai or Chicago first?
  - Luxury lad. Tell 'em to bring us back a big cat.
  - Excited for Zem Lips to be bitchin' in that deep dish.
  - I stayed out in the sun too long, I got burnt really bad. Can I turn the sun
    off until I'm feeling a little better?
  - Something feels really off right now... I can't put my finger on it.
  - Did you just kill Zem Lips??? Dude!
  - I was sitting on the beach, the beach chair I was on like folded inwards or something
    stupid and now i'm stuck in it. Can you send someone to come get me out?
  - Why do you always fall into the Bloof Gloof trap...
  - I forgot that you could just teleport things. Definitely the smarter choice.
  - I missed my plane to Hawaii, now all these humans are staring at me in the airport.
  - Zem can finally put that chameleon skin to good use.
  - That's a way to deal with that.
  - Do you know any good deep sea travel spots? LIke marina's trench?
  - TO THE TRENCH!
  - I hope Zem Lips gets to meet David Bowie down there.
  - I found this love questionnaire on the human's websites... should I fill it out?
  - I wanna see it, I wanna fill it out too.
  - Why'd you yuck Mire Oodle's yum, dude?
  - A small request... I would like to separate the Earth from its sheep species,
    they are so soft, loving, sweet... I will make a new home for them on Glorf 31
    with me alone as their shepherd.
  - Hopefully this'll cure Mire Oodle's crippling loneliness.
  - Baaa humbug.
  - I look at Earth, it is a rock, everyone on it so sad... I want it gone, I want
    to raise the temperature, them to all disintegrate, to lower the temperature...
    them to all freeze... something so they stop hurting one another so uncontrollably...
    please...
  - The Earth burns according to Mire Oodle's neuroticism.
  - 'Ice Age 5 of many to come: The Mire Oodle freezing.'
  - I'm getting bullied.... :(
  - Eh you probably the right move. Bloof Gloof can be a freak.
  - HAHA HOLY SHIT!!! WHAT DID YOU JUST DO DUDE???
  - What's your zodiac sign?
  - Mine's Uranus.
  - I have the same sign also!
  - I threw a party but none of the other aliens showed up....
  - Wow I'm glad you did not just teleport me to that party. I would be so pissed.
  - Look at those pigs dance with Mire Oodle!
  - I've heard more about this... uh... astrology. From a human friend (which I have
    definitely). .... ...so yeah... where were you exerted from your maternal unit?
  - As was I, dude.
  - I'm guessing Goya was born there too?
  - So continuing... down my astrological journey... I made this social media page
    to give the humans daily updates on how to commune with the planets...
  - Yeah dude, we can't have the humans knowing about our intergalactic BBQ's.
  - Hey, you should follow me back also, dude, you ass.
  - I've gained... five billion followers on my astrology account... ....the humans
    are asking for a face reveal... is it time?
  - Woah... deep. Seems like he might need some space on that thought. Haha, get
    it? Space?
  - Reverent advice, my guy.
  - I've taken some time to think about it... the Face Reveal... if I post it, it
    may cure my loneliness, as you said... I can connect to the collective unconscious
    of an entire species... But then... I am Mire Oodle, the Lonely Alien. Who am
    I without my loneliness?
  - On the Earth Shift, we make gods.
  - Omg. Mire really lived a little... I hope to Smog these aren't their gonads.
  - I have posted the face pic. The rotisserie has not been mentioned. I am now being
    hunted by the humans that once loved me. This has helped nothing. I am more lonely
    than ever.
  - Let's reverse the hunt!
  - It's game day, mate!
  - Thank you for the help with the bullies, Lixel Zeoop... oh and just so you know...
    the bullies were the earth geese of the Earth Canadia.... I tried to pet one...
    the devilish fiend... at first I thought it was so sweet and gentle... and it
    pulled four of my phalanex of my left spulkrum! So now their species has paid.
  - Honk honk, motherfucker.
  - Honk honk, motherfucker.
  - ???I would like to insert a new gene into the contemporary eastern squirrel species.
    It will make them all hunger for the blood of newborn mammals.???
  - Wow look at those squirrels GO.
  - You gave him reign to do whatever wasn't that, I guess...
  - It is time to screen the planetary fecal matter regulatory index. Shall I initiate
    the conformity swab?
  - Haha holy fuck dude all those earthlings are gonna be PISSED... your job sucks
    so bad.
  - That was honestly a pretty decent way to deal with that dude.
  - The department of Glorf 31 science affairs asked for a generalized sample of
    the eye cones residing in every underwater species. In order to do this, I believe
    we could raise the temperature of the ocean to kill a good amount of them and
    easily harvest such organs. Do we have your go ahead?
  - I guess that earth's gonna embark upon some major bloodbath vibes... due to Glorf
    31. We're sort of messy.
  - Aw that's too bad, I was looking forward to the color implants that Glarbarf
    inc was gonna release with the new tech from that...
  - Everything on earth is born and dies too quickly. In order to slow down this
    process of decay, I propose we decrease the global temperature in order to lets
    say... refrigerate  the specimens to enact scientific activities upon them more
    effectively.
  - Cryogenic sleep time, bro. I'm glad to just be chilling here watching tv instead
    of being CHILLED like those fools.
  - It is so fun to see Elglore running around trying to trap earthlings like that.
  - It's time to give the humans the olive oil to crude oil conversion secret of
    our peoples.
  - The ultimate secret? Gone.
  - Def too dangerous. The right call right there.
  - We are going to put space sac pheremones into the krill population.
  - Those krill have TEETH now, dude. The right decision.
  - Ah! Krill in space!
  - There's this virus I found that is highly contagious, if you give it to the humans
    they'll all work from home and buckle even more under capitalism.
  - I can hear the earthlings coughing from here.
  - Dude... did WE invent capitalism?
  - I believe it is time to increase the supplies of oil within earth.
  - What even is oil? I'd never heard of it until you started working this job.
  - Oh, like Venus! I'm sure the earthlings will love that!
  - I would like to initiate extreme deforestation on the entirety of all earth's
    forests. This would engage for me a monopoly over all wood products, rendering
    me monetarily powerful over the species of the earth.
  - Do we even have an economy? I thought that was an earth concept specifically.
  - Aw, no more nut.
  - We have a plan to release vast amounts of raw cash into all world economies,
    from amounts of honey in beehives to light resources on the bottom of the ocean
    floor, to the Canadian dollar. This will cause inflation on an unprecedented
    scale and be extremely beneficial to Glorf 31 interplanetary investment prospects.
  - Give the bees a break!
  - I GUESS thats a valid reason to say no...
  - I would like to steal Ronald Reagan's frozen body from the celebrity body compendium
    of the United States of America.
  - I bet the evangelicals will love this one.
  - Trickle down fecal matter!
  - We need 20 Snarkoffs for our hedge fund.
  - 20 Snarkoffs? Dude that's like the entire government budget!
  - Ideal way to shut that loser down.
  - It's time for mosquitoes to go.
  - Dude, you just wiped out an entire species. Fuck.
  - Yeah, right? They sort of remind me of one of my aunts.
  - I have a plan to transform all rocks into type igneous.
  - That seemed like one of his more harmless requests... maybe?
  - You just completely messed up the earth!!!
  - If we make everything on Earth human, I think then maybe we could also include
    a social decree to make cannibalism not just acceptable but necessary in the
    Earth culture.
  - Wow bro they really all are just eating each other now... I think you just made
    a BAD CHOICE.
  - You just told S'SSS SSSSS to do something else... what did he even just do???
  - I want to change every human's name to Alex.
  - Yeah sure, it'll be easier to keep track of them that way... or something.
  - I GUESS thats a valid reason to say no...
  - All creatures now only have left feet.
  - Maybe now they'll stop worrying about existentialism.
  - That's sort of as messed up as them all having left feet, sometimes I feel like
    you're ruthless.
  - All creatures are only allowed to be awake at 2pm UTC.
  - Earth-wide rise-and-shine party!!!!
  - They're all gonna die, dude.
  - It seems the creatures The Mire Oodle is being aggrieved upon by are The Earth
    Geese. How shall I assimilate them?
  - Every duck is now ugly.
  - Shove them in the crust!
